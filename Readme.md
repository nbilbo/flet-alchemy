# Flet-Alchemy

## Technologies Used
Task Manager was built using the following technologies:
- **flet** - A lightweight framework used for building the view layer of the application.
- **SQLAlchemy** - A powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool used for building the models.

- User authentication: Users can log in to their account with their username and password.
